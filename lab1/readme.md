# Lab1--Performance Measure(POW)

We kindly leaked some personal information in the Peer Review version.

Never do that again.

Leave the `lab1pr.zip` as it is so that ever time we see it, we get warned.

`code` folder contains the newest algorithm implementation and test implementation.

`document` folder contains the newest PDF version of the project report.

`Report Files` contains some assets of the project report.

`lab1.zip` is the first submitted final version.

`lab1improved.zip` is the second submitted final version(improved).

`lab1pr.zip` is to warn us.
